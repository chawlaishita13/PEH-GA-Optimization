# PEH-GA-Optimization
## Summary
In this report, Genetic Algorithm based optimization of the piezoelectric energy harvester is demonstrated. Optimization results obtained from Genetic Algorithm were thoroughly analysed.
Hence, we can draw conclusion from the above experimentation results that linear as well as non-linear piezoelectric energy harvesters can be a good way to harvest electrical power and both can be optimized using genetic algorithm. 
We demonstrated an enhancement of energy harvesting through GA and the voltage improved by 0.998V in comparison with un-optimized harvesters for linear harvesters whereas we observed an improvement of 2.099V in the harvested voltage for the nonlinear harvesters. The designers may use their own set of ranges for parameters of the energy harvester based on the use case to obtain the optimized parameters for maximum voltage. The improvement in harvested voltage was gained along with physical size reduction in several aspects such as beam width and piezoelectric film length. While optimizing the parameters using Genetic Algorithm, the load was kept constant. So, we performed a resistance load sweep to obtain the peak Power Integral for the optimized parameters. We studied the power integral optimization and obtained that by increasing the load resistance, power integral first increases, reaches a peak value and subsequently decreases. Also, with an increase in acceleration, the maximum value of power integral increased.
